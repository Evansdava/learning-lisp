## A repository for learning Common Lisp

Following [Practical Common Lisp, by Peter Seibel](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)

To run the files in this repo, install [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell) with the command `brew install roswell`

Then use the command `ros run` to start a REPL (Read, Eval, Print Loop)

You can load files with the command `(load "<filename>")` and then run any functions within them with `(<function-name>)`
